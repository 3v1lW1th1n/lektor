Changelog
=========

These are all the changes in Lektor since the first public release.

1.1

Bugfix release

- Fixed a bug where resolving URL paths outside of alts did not
  fall back to asset resolving.
- Added `_discoverable` system field which controls if a page should show
  up in `children`.  The default is that a page is discoverable.  Setting it
  to `False` means in practical terms that someone needs to know the URL as
  all collection operations will not return it.
