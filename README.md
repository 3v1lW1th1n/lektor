# Lektor

Lektor is a static website generator.  It builds out an entire project
from static files into many individual HTML pages and has a built-in
admin UI and minimal desktop app.

To see how it works look at the ``example`` folder which contains a
very basic project to get started.

For a more complete website look at [lektor/lektor-website](https://github.com/lektor/lektor-website)
which contains the sourcecode for the official lektor website.
